addopts = -vv
markers =
    smoke: Fast, critical tests that verify core functionality.
    regression: Broader coverage tests to catch regressions.
    negative: Tests that validate error handling and invalid inputs.
    data_quality: Tests that validate data ranges, formats, and consistency.
    domain: Tests that validate domain-specific rules (e.g., expected Pokemon types).
    integration: Tests that hit real external systems (network/API). Run only when explicitly enabled (e.g., RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1) to avoid flaky CI.
